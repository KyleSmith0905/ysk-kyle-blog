        Greetings, I want to start this blog as a way to share my experience with others. Many times I run across a programming topic that doesn't feel properly documented. Sometimes a technology has something I wish I knew ahead of time. This blog serves as my personal outlet to the world of programming. I wish to implement some form of feedback or comment system to allow an open discussion, but that will stay a side project.
      </p>

        I believe that AI is the future, I use it for sample content writing, programming, and basic inquiries. I do not believe that AI should be used for content writing in production. I believe personal communications would feel a lot less personal if it was known that an AI wrote it. If an article is written by AI, I will attach a note about on the top describing how AI was involved with the development of the article.
